== Notes:
These are juicy as hell, since they're bathing in their own goodness as they cook. While a grill gives you that beautiful distinctive flavor, it loses some drippings to the grate.

== Ingredients:
- 2 lbs ground chuck
- 3 tsp. Worchestershire sauce
- #xfrac(1, 2) tsp. garlic powder
- #xfrac(1, 4) tsp. onion powder
- 2 tsp. salt
- Freshly-cracked black pepper (to taste)

== Directions:
1. Prepare a baking sheet by covering it in aluminum foil and a thin layer of oil.
2. Preheat oven to 400$degree$F.
3. In a large bowl, mix all ingredients until just combined (do not overwork the meat).
4. Create 8 equally-sized patties that are slightly wider than the buns you're working with -- they should be very, very thin. They will thicken as they cook, so give each patty a wide, shallow indent in the center to prevent pillification.
  - If you have one, use a scale to get perfectly equal patties.
  - If you have one, use a rolling pin to get perfectly even (pre-indent) patties.
5. Bake for 5 minutes, flip, then bake for 4 minutes. This will yield medium-well patties -- adjust cook time according to preference.
6. Let patties cool for a bit before freezing them.
