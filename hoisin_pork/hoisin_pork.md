Hoisin Pork
Marinade:
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp chili garlic paste
- 1/4 cup Hoisin

Marinade 8 thick pork chops.

Preheat oven to 300째F.

Carrots:
- 2 lbs baby carrots
- olive oil to generously coat
- salt and pepper to taste

Potatoes:
- 3 lbs baby potatoes, chopped down to 1 in cubes if larger
- olive oil to generously coat
- salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste

Coat and season potatoes and carrots.

Put pork chops on baking tray, drizzling what didn't stick to them on top. Salt to taste.

Pour taters and carrots on another tray.

After oven is at temp, insert porkchops.

After 5 minutes, with chops still inside, raise oven temp to 425째F.

After 10 minutes, when oven is to temp, insert tater and carrot tray.

Cook pork until 145째F minimum internal temperature, and cook taters and carrots till soft.

Notes:
- Needs more flavor on the chops. Hoisin, chili-garlic, and soy sauce could perhaps be reduced over the stovetop into a thicker sauce?
  - Actually, just mixing the sauce up 1:1:1 and dipping the cooked chop in it seemed to work
- Taters and carrots should be cooked at 400째F for 25 (35??) minutes
- 8 carrots per serving
- 9-10 smalltatoes per serving
- ok ok 1/4 hoisin, 1/4 soy sauce, 1/8 cup sriracha for da sauce to drizzle on after cooking
