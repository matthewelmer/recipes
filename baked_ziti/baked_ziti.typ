== Ingredients
- 1 pound dry ziti pasta
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 pound lean ground beef

- 6 oz provolone cheese, sliced
- 1 #tfrac[1/2] cups sour cream
- 6 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 2 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese

== Instructions
+ Boil a large pot of salted water and add the pasta. Cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.

+ Brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes

+ Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.

+ In order from bottom layer to top, put the following layers in the baking dish:
    + #tfrac[1/2] the ziti
    + provolone cheese
    + sour cream
    + #tfrac[1/2] the meat sauce
    + remaining ziti
    + mozzarella
    + remaining meat sauce
    + grated parmesan

+ Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes.
